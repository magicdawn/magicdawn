## code splitting

> To clarify a common misunderstanding: Code Splitting is not just about extracting common code into a shared chunk. The more notable feature is that Code Splitting can be used to split code into an **on demand** loaded chunk. This can keep the initial download small and downloads code on demand when requested by the application.

Code Splitting 不仅仅是将一些公共的代码打包一下. 更值得注意的特性是可以将代码分离到按需加载的 chunk. 可以保持最开始下载很小以及按需下载代码.
